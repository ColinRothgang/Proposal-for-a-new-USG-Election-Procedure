\paragraph{The problem of continuity and unfamiliarity with USG procedures} This problem is addressed by the proposal, since all elected members must be previous USG members and committee chairs are previous committee members. 

\paragraph{The right of the committees to have a say in the choice of their chair}
This problem is fully resolved by the proposal. 

\paragraph{Equal representation of committees in the parliament}
This problem is not addressed by the proposal.

\paragraph{Inflexibility of the election system}
This problem fixed as well. 

\paragraph{Legitimacy of the chair} The main drawback\protect\footnote{This can also be a strength, as the example of the FAC this semester shows.} of this proposal is the fact that committee chairs no longer need to be elected members. This somewhat impacts the legitimacy of the committee and can also affect the representation of the committee in the parliament (this is also the reason to invite the chair to the parliament).
