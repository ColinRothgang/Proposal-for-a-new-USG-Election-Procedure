The idea is to elect the members of parliament from current USG members, to allow the committees to decide on their own chair and to elect the (vice)-president among the parliament members.
In practice the Members of Parliament and Committee chairs would be chosen as follows. 

At the end of each semester, USG members can run for members of parliament and the $N+2$ candidates with most votes are elected $N+2$ (where $N$ denotes the number of committees in the USG, currently 3). 
The parliament members elect a (vice)-president among themselves. 

At the same time each semester the committees elect a (co)-chair among its members with at least least one semester membership. If the chair is not themself a member of parliament, they is invited as a standing guest to the parliament and gains voting rights for matters in the responsibility of them committee. 

Each USG member may have at most one (co)-chair position in the USG committees.
